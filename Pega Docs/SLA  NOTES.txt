                                          Service-level agreement
                                          -----------------------

Service-level agreements:
------------------------
A service-level agreement (SLA) establishes a work completion deadline. Organizations often establish service-level agreements to enforce on-time performance. These obligations range from informal response-time promises to negotiated contracts. 
Service-level intervals:
------------------------
Each service-level agreement supports a few intervals of time that standardize how long you have to perform a task or resolve a case.
Consider a company's timesheet submission requirements. Employees must submit a timesheet within two business days of the workweek's end but no later than three business days.
Types of service-level agreements:
----------------------------------
You can configure SLAs on case types, stages, processes, and Collect Information and Approval steps. SLAs are most often applied at the case or step level, but having more points to add urgency or escalation actions may be of interest depending on the business case. When you apply SLAs at different levels, you need to consider all SLAs when determining intervals.
1.Case-level SLA:
  With SLAs configured on a case type, the service-level timing begins when a case is created (or recently reopened) and stops when the case is resolved.

  For example, you configure an SLA with a goal of 60 hours and deadline of 72 hours. If a prospective customer does not receive a quote within 72 hours,
  the case is considered late. The case-level SLA should be used to define the stage, process, and assignment-level SLAs.
2.Stage-level SLA:
  With SLAs defined on a stage, the service-level timing begins when a case enters the stage and ends when the case leaves the stage.

  For example, you configure an SLA on the Quote Creation and Presentation stage with a goal of 12 hours and a deadline of 24 hours. The SLA ensures that     
  the quote is generated and that the customer receives email notification within 24 hours of quote approval
3.Process-level SLA:
  With SLAs defined on a process, the service-level timing begins when the process is called and ends when the last step in the process completes.

  For example, you configure an SLA on the Review Request process with a goal of 24 hours and a deadline of 48 hours. The SLA ensures that underwriters    
  assigned to a specific quote complete both the review request assignment and request approval in 48 hours or less from the quote request submission date.    
  The process-level SLA should be used to define the assignment-level SLAs.
4.Assignment-level SLA
  With SLAs configured on Collect Information steps, the service-level timing begins when an assignment is created and ends after assignment completion.
  For example, in the quote request case, you configure an SLA on the Review request assignment with a goal of 12 hours and a deadline of 24 hours. The SLA    
  ensures that underwriters review the request within 24 hours of receiving the request; otherwise, the assignment is late.
5.Approval-level SLA
  With SLAs configured on Approval steps, the service-level timing begins when the approval is called and ends after the approval completion.
  For example, in the quote request case, you define an SLA on the Approve request step with a goal of 12 hours and deadline of 24 hours. The SLA ensures a
  that underwriters approve the request within 24 hours of completing the review.

Escalation actions:
-------------------
Escalation actions are actions that your application takes to facilitate faster resolution times based on a specified service-level agreement. You can configure escalation actions on service-level agreements to:
Notify the assignee, the manager, and the participants.
Reassign the task.
Resolve the case as the goals or deadlines occur.
 
Work prioritization:
--------------------
In Pega Platformâ„¢, work is prioritized based on urgency. Depending on your business requirements, you can prioritize work based on deadlines.

Urgency-based prioritization:
-----------------------------
Urgency is a numeric value that brings visibility to the unresolved work in your application. There are two primary types of urgency: 
Case urgency is the priority of the case. For example, in a parent case type for managing hospital patient records, a child case for updating current records may have a higher priority than a child case for transferring previous records. 
Assignment urgency is the priority of completing an assignment. For example, collecting information on a new patient may have a lower priority than sending a prescription for an existing patient. 
The initial urgency of an assignment is equal to the case urgency value. By default, case urgency is 10. 
For each interval, you define a value between 1 and 100 by which to increase the urgency. The maximum urgency is 100. The higher the urgency value, the more important it is to address that work item.

Assignment priority:
--------------------
In Pega Platform applications, assignment urgency indicates assignment priority.
The Pega Platform Get Next Work functionality assigns high-urgency tasks before low-urgency tasks to ensure that assignments finish on time. Get Next Work favors the assignment with the greatest urgency between two or more assignments that users can perform.

Deadline-based prioritization:
------------------------------
Many organizations find it beneficial to make SLAs deadline-focused rather than urgency-focused. For some case types, time-based deadlines, rather than urgency deadlines, provide the most important information you need to prioritize work. For example, multiple Mortgage loan case types can be prioritized solely based on when they are submitted. 
Consider a software license purchasing case type. Multiple case instances are created at different times. A customer service representative (CSR) works on multiple assignments for each case, while the purchasing and manager roles have one assignment for each case. In the following image, click the + icons to learn how deadline-based assignment prioritization works with three case instances with different creation times.
